# ENGG1340--Group_Project-
ENGG1340-(Group_Project) By @Uzair05 and @tridib13

## Introduction
Our project is the group project assigned to us by the University of Hong Kong course code ENGG1340.
For this project we chose to create a **Table Managment System** and try to work out solutions for an actual restaurant.

We tried to model our project based on what we perceived would be the main issues faced by real life restaurants.
The goal of this project is to automate as many functions as possible to reduce the pressure on restaurant staff and create a sense of efficiency.
Alongside the suggested problems given to us by the University we plan to add more functions and capability and allow for a flexible programming to enable a more customizable program. In essence each Deli manager will independantly be able to modify their Program *without the prior need of knowledge in programming or having to hire programmers.*

## Problem Statement
The family-owned Deli restaurants need a system which would allow them to efficiently book, clear and bill tables. Some of the problems are listed as such:
1. They would need to be able to book tables without the extensive use of having to refer to a manual paper-back register.
2. They would need to be able to handle booking, clearing and billing of tables without the need of multiple staff. This would require a system which can automate the process to a large extent.
3. They would need a system which could suggest tables as well as be able to flexible in managing the number of customers and the location of their table/tables.
   - The system should also be able to suggest and allocate seats at different tables if there are too many guest in one group.
4. They would need a system that allows the table to be released and opened for next booking.
5. A system would also be required to keep track of all the bills of each table to prevent any mishaps.
   - They would also need to be able to keep track of individual customers bills in case the requested for split bills.
6. They would definitely require the ability to cancel the booking and clear the table for booking if the customer is late more than a period of time.
   - If there is no table/seat available for the customer on the time he wishes to book then the program should be able to suggest the closest available timing.
   - The system should also allow space for the customer to be able to cancel the booking.
7. Some restaurants may require extra functionality such:
   - The ability to keep track of regulars and the times they usually frequent.
   - The ability to see the trend and success rate of each dish, maybe also allow the customers to rate their experience and give feed back.
   - The ability to track trend of sales according to calendar dates.
   - The ability to start making preparations for the dish requested by the customers a period before He/She arrives so that the time taken to serve the meal could be reduced.
8. the restaurant may also have a problem with trolls or people who make a booking and do not show up. This could be an issue if the customer books a large number of tables and did not show up as these tables wouldn't be able to be booked by other customers.

## Functionality
Our program will be able to complete the following tasks:

1. The Program would be able to book and clear tables.
2. The Program would be able to check the availability of tables and make suggestion if any shortcoming occurs.
3. The Program would be able to handle the billing of tables and/or individual customers.
4. The Program would be able to allow room for customer to cancel the booking before a certain time period so that it can be made available for other customers.
5. The Program would be able to take note of expected arrival time of customer/s and may clear the table for booking if the customer is late beyond a certain period of time.
6. The Program would be able to take note of trends of sales and make take note the behaviour of regulars allowing for better service.
7. The Program would be able to allow customers the option to opt for a "prepared meal" i.e. the meal preparation occurs a short while before they arrive so that they can wait for less time.
8. The Program would be able to exhibit extra features such as tracking the success and popularity of certain dishes.
9. The Program would be able to implement a reward system for loyal customers to ensure their continued support.
10. The Program would be able to allow the Restaurant to change the setting of the program such as toggling the extra-features and changing the number of tables and seats of each respective table.
11. The Program would be able to implement a penalty or fine to no show customers who book large number of tables or book a "prepared meal" and didnt show up.


## Conclusion

Most restaurants in these modern days are suffering from a lack of cheap and available manpower and we aim to lift their burden. Through our project, we wish to come up with an efficient, secure, and transparent process to give both restaurant owners and customers a seamless experience. Our project will aim to solve as many problems as is encountered in restaurants these days and will also adapt to changes in customer needs and trends taking into account various factors like seasonality, etc.
