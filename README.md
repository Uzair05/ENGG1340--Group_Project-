ENGG1340-(Group_Project) By @Uzair05 and @tridib13

## Introduction
Our project is the group project assigned to us by the University of Hong Kong course code ENGG1340.
For this project we chose to create a **Table Management System** and try to work out solutions for an actual restaurant.

We tried to model our project based on what we perceived would be the main issues faced by real life restaurants.
The goal of this project is to automate as many functions as possible to reduce the pressure on restaurant staff and create a sense of efficiency.

## Problem Statement
The restaurant in question currently runs its business as a family-owned Deli. They recieve customers as well as allow for booking of tables for customers. 
The restaurant operates by normally allowing customer/s to book a table in their restaurant as well as allowing walkin customers.
The management often complain of the laborous need to manage booking via the traditional phone booking as the number of customers grow. They also have to manage the cancellation of bookings as well a the billing of the individual tables.
There are also complaints that the management have to put in extra effort in sorting and suggesting tables to groups of odd numbers of customers.
Another issue found is that the management has to actively keep track of the time a certain group has been occupying their table. They must also stay aware of the seasonal trends and behavior of customers during such seasons, as such they regularly need to update their database on the number seats of each rearranged table.
They must also make room for errors such two members of the same group making overlapping bookings etc. And they need to improve their efficiency in their ability to keep track of the orders of each table so that their bill doesn't get mixed up or miscounted.
