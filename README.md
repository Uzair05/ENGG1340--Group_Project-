# ENGG1340--Group_Project-
ENGG1340-(Group_Project) By @Uzair05 and @tridib13

## Introduction
Our project is the group project assigned to us by the University of Hong Kong course code ENGG1340.
For this project we chose to create a **Table Managment System** and try to work out solutions for an actual restaurant.

We tried to model our project based on what we perceived would be the main issues faced by real life restaurants.
The goal of this project is to automate as many functions as possible to reduce the pressure on restaurant staff and create a sense of efficiency.
Alongside the suggested problems given to us by the University we plan to add more functions and capability and allow for a flexible programming to enable a more customizable program. In essence each Deli manager will independantly be able to modify their Program *without the prior need of knowledge in programming or having to hire programmers.*

## Problem Statement
The family-owned Deli restaurants need a system which would allow them to efficiently book, clear and bill tables. Some of the problems are listed as such:
1. They would need to be able to book tables without the extensive use of having to refer to a manual paper-back register.
2. They would need to be able to handle booking, clearing and billing of tables without the need of multiple staff. This would require a system which can automate the process to a large extent.
3. They would need a system which could suggest tables as well as be able to flexible in managing the number of customers and the location of their table/tables.
   - The system should also be able to suggest and allocate seats at different tables if there are too many guest in one group.
4. They would need a system that allows the table to be released and opened for next booking.
5. A system would also be required to keep track of all the bills of each table to prevent any mishaps.
   - They would also need to be able to keep track of individual customers bills in case the requested for split bills.
6. They would definitely require the ability to cancel the booking and clear the table for booking if the customer is late more than a period of time.
   - If there is no table/seat available for the customer on the time he wishes to book then the program should be able to suggest the closest available timing.
   - The system should also allow space for the customer to be able to cancel the booking.
7. Some restaurants may require extra functionality such:
   - The ability to keep track of regulars and the times they usually frequent.
   - The ability to see the trend and success rate of each dish, maybe also allow the customers to rate their experience and give feed back.
   - The ability to start making preparations for the dish requested by the customers a period before He/She arrives so that the time taken to serve the meal could be reduced.


## Functionality

Our program will be able to complete the following tasks:

1. The availability of a table.
2. A system to book a table and a penalty system imposed for when the customer fails to show up.
3. To assign a group of customers the minimum number of seats for a table when the tables for that particular number are occupied.
4. A notification system to inform the waiter about customers who take longer than a specified amount of time (preferably 2 hours).
5. Changes in number of tables according to changes in the customer base.
6. Tentatively design an online form which customers can fill in to book their table and even order food so that they can have the food served as soon as they arrive. Penalty will be imposed if the customer fails to show up.
