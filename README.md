# ENGG1340--Group_Project-
ENGG1340-(Group_Project) By Uzair and Tridib

## Introduction
Our project is the group project assigned to us by the University of Hong Kong course code ENGG1340.
For this project we chose to create a **Table Managment System** and try to work out solutions for an actual restaurant.

We tried to model our project based on what we percived would be the main issues faced by real life restaurants.
The goal of this project is to automate as many functions as possible to reduce the pressure on restaurant staff and create a sense of efficiency.
Alongside the suggested problems given to us by the University we plan to add more functions and capability and allow for a flexible programming to enable a more customizable program. In essence each Deli management will independantly be able to Modify their Program *without the need of knowledge in programming or having to hire programmers.*
