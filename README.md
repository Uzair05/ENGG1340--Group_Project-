# ENGG1340--Group_Project-
ENGG1340-(Group_Project) By Uzair and Tridib

## Introduction
Our project is the group project assigned to us by the University of Hong Kong course code ENGG1340.
For this project we chose to create a **Table Managment System** and try to work out solutions for an actual restaurant.

We tried to model our project based on what we perceived would be the main issues faced by real life restaurants.
The goal of this project is to automate as many functions as possible to reduce the pressure on restaurant staff and create a sense of efficiency.
Alongside the suggested problems given to us by the University we plan to add more functions and capability and allow for a flexible programming to enable a more customizable program. In essence each Deli manager will independantly be able to modify their Program *without the need of knowledge in programming or having to hire programmers.*

Our program will be able to complete the following tasks:

1. The availability of a table.
2. A system to book a table and a penalty system imposed for when the customer fails to show up.
3. To assign a group of customers the minimum number of seats for a table when the tables for that particular number are occupied.
4. A notification system to inform the waiter about customers who take longer than a specified amount of time (preferably 2 hours).
5. Changes in number of tables according to changes in the customer base.
6. Tentatively design an online form which customers can fill in to book their table and even order food so that they can have the food served as soon as they arrive. Penalty will be imposed if the customer fails to show up.
